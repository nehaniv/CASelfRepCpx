#  Cellular Automata, Self-Reproduction & Complexity

# Prof. Chrystopher L. Nehaniv (University of Waterloo, Canada)

*Abstract (for Web Publicity)

Cellular automata (CAs) are a widely applied model of massively parallel computation based on local neighborhoods and updates introduced by John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam. The tutorial introduces the concepts of cellular automata and examples, and overviews basic results, such as for the Game of Life (which is computationally universal and shows emergent properties), and variations of the cellular automata concept, including random boolean networks, synchronous and asynchronous automata networks, and discrete dynamical systems with external inputs. Von Neumann, one of the grandfathers, of Artificial Life and Computational Intelligence, also used CAs as a formal tool to study the logic of life and complexity: in particular, How is self-reproduction is possible, i.e., How is it possible for a mechanistic system to reproduce itself?  How is it possible for something to produce something as or more complex than itself? Prior to the discovery of the structure of DNA and its relation to these questions, von Neumann gave several different solutions. It turns out that some correspond to life as we now know it, and others perhaps to life as it could be. We survey his solutions to these problems, and discuss progress on this question since then on self-reproducing systems. Also, we survey open problems for Artificial Life and Computational Intelligence research that go beyond the state of the art in the synthesis of self-reproducing systems, and offer challenges for researchers entering the field including those related to the concepts of individuality, robustness, evolution and self-production (autopoiesis).
•	Target participants: Everyone attending IEEE-CIS 2024 wanting to understand Cellular Automata (CAs), Self-Reproduction, and their relationship to Complexity, including students new to the field as well as established researchers from academia and industry. The tutorial is designed to bring participants up to speed in basic knowledge on cellular automata (CAs) and generalizations without assuming prior background in the field. Computational Intelligence researchers, biologists, engineers, and complexity researchers who wish to understand these techniques, their historical development and applications, and role in the study of self-reproducing systems will be introduced to state-of-the-art knowledge in this area and prepared to investigate a range of open problems in emergence of complexity of living and life-like systems.

*Which IEEE SSCI symposia the proposal is relevant for (one primary or multiple):

The tutorial will primarily complement the proposed symposium IEEE ALIFE-CIS on Computational Intelligence for Artificial Life and Cooperative Intelligent Systems, co-organized by the tutorial speaker as technical activities liason and co-chair. The techniques covered will also be of interest to some participants in other IEEE SSCI Symposia such as IEEE CISM, IEEE CIETES, IEEE CIHM, IEEE CiFer, IEEE CIHM, in fields were CA and related CI methods are applied, and IEEE CITREx where related ethical considerations arise. 

*	An overview of the topic explaining its relevance and significance to Applied Computational Intelligence
  
CAs and their generalizations are widely used through computational intelligence in areas of artificial life, discrete space-time simulations, genetic regulatory networks, agent-based models for various applications in science and engineering, including physical, biomedical and ecological models,  as sociotechnical, economic and environment systems with agent- and/or distributed spatial or network structure. The often exhibit emergent behaviour and give insight leading to predictive models of all manner of complex systems.

*	Tutorial schedule with topic and time allocation. 

30 minutes – Cellular Automata as a computational intelligence methodology and model of massively parallel computation and relation to other Computational Intelligence methods (random Boolean networks, discrete dynamical systems, automata networks, genetic regulatory networks, dynamic networks, and agent-based systems), examples and applications. 

30 minutes – Complexity, John von Neumann and the Problems of Self-Reproduction. Links of Cellular Automata to Biology and Artificial Life Systems, Different Solutions to Self-Reproduction, State of the Art in Self-Reproducing Systems.

20-30 minutes - Unsolved Problems and Open Challenges for researchers. Discussion of Participants’ application ideas (selected questions for Q&A).

*Explain how we will engage the attendees and contribute to interaction 

After presenting initial ideas and methods, the audience will be challenged to answer questions about the predicted behaviour of CAs via examples. Visually striking simulations will be conducted illustrating the concepts. In covering the connections to Self-Reproduction, the audience will be challenged to answer von Neumann’s questions and we will make the links to biological knowledge. Challenge problems and open questions where researchers entering the field may contribute will be discussed, and Q&A for participants’ own suggested applications will engage participants with the methods.

Prof. Nehaniv holds a BSc from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley, both in Mathematics. He has been playing with, teaching and researching cellular automata, their generalizations, self-reproduction, and complexity for over 30 years. He has taught generations of students Computational Intelligence, Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence Robotics starting from 1995, and co-developed the graduate courses “Artificial Life with Robotics” at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, and “Artificial Life: Biology & Computation”, and “Artificial Life: Embodied Intelligence” at the University of Waterloo, where he also teaches Complex Systems to advanced students, as well courses on discrete and continuous Dynamic Systems to engineers, scientists and complex systems modellers. He is currently Associate Editor of the journals _BioSystems_, I_nteraction Studies_, and C_omplexity_, and as a founding member served as past Chair for the IEEE Task Force on Artificial Life and Complex Systems, which organizes the IEEE Artificial Life and Cooperative Intelligent Systems Symposium (IEEE ALIFE-CIS), and is a founding member of IEEE SHIELD. Dr. Nehaniv is a computer scientist, mathematician, and complex systems scientist with contributions also to systems biology, neuroscience, emergence of language, artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics. He has held positions as Lecturer and Post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and then as full Professor in Computer Science in Japan and the UK, and, since 2018, in Systems Design Engineering and in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada.
